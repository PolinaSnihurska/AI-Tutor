### Heatmap Interpretation

The heatmap shows where your child struggles:

- **Red Topics**: High error rate (60%+ mistakes)
  - Action: Needs focused practice and possibly tutoring
  
- **Yellow Topics**: Moderate errors (30-60% mistakes)
  - Action: Needs additional practice

  - Action: Mastered, maintain with periodic review

### Success Predictions
